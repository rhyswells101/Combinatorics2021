This algorithm was inspired by Jon Woolf. See MSA-Musings for theory (to be written up).

See comments in Epsilon_P_4 for a description of the main code.

Files Epsilon_P_5 and Epsilon_P_6_Too_Long are similar with adjustments to higher dimensions.

P_4_extensions and P_5_extensions are used to store the functions to be loaded in other files through pickling.

xlsx files are for excel computations.

File P_4 contains analysis on the 154 functions.
